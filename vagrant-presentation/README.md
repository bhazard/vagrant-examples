vagrant-presentation
============

This is a 15 minute presentation about [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) that I gave at [Asbury Agile](http://www.asburyagile.com/) in October 2014. You can [view the presentation](htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bhazard/vagrant-examples/blob/master/vagrant-presentation/index.html). 


### References

This presentation is written using [impress.js](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js)

Vagrant can be downloaded from [VagrantUp](https://www.vagrantup.com).  I used
version 1.6.5 for the demos.

You'll also need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or similar -- Hyper-V, VMWare Workstation, or Fusion will do.

I demonstrated [Vagrantpress](http://vagrantpress.org/) at the conference.
